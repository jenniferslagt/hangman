Old school hangman! Programming languages: REACT, TYPESCRIPT

## Working with React and TypeScript

## Learning goals
At first, I started with a tutorial refresh my React skills (mixed with TypeScript). During this, I made some [notes](https://github.com/jenniferslagt/hangman/wiki/React-setup) to make sure that I understood the learnings.
* Building function based components
* Rendering markup with JSX
* Managing states
* Passing input (variables, functions, HTML) via props
* Looping
* Handing events
* Debugging react apps
